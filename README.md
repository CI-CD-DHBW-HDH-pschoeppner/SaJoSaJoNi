# Tic Tac Toe

This is a beautifully clean repo that builds upon a browser-based game of Tic Tac Toe. The wonderful developer group by the enigmatic name of **"SaJoSaJoNi"** is doing a stellar job of housekeeping. You won't find questionable commit messages or force pushes on `main` around here. Never. Only professionals at work.

## How to play
The unnecessarily detailed guide for idiots:
1. Make sure your computer is turned on.
2. Have a browser installed.
3. Open your browser.
4. Click on the browser address bar.
5. Enter [https://ci-cd-dhbw-hdh-pschoeppner.github.io/SaJoSaJoNi/](https://ci-cd-dhbw-hdh-pschoeppner.github.io/SaJoSaJoNi/) into the address bar.
6. Smash your fist onto the `enter` key in frustration after realising you could have just clicked on the link instead of entering text.
7. Lose against unbeatable bots.
8. Rage-quit.[^1]
